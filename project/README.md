For our second project we are to use the MSP430 to design a simple
toy. The toy should at minimum:

- generate sounds
- dynamically change the LEDs that are illuminated, both brightly and dimmly
- implement a state machine to maintain the state of the toy
- and use the four buttons on the expansion board (P2.0-3) to transition the
  state machine

At least one of the functions to transition the state machine must be written
in assembly.

Description of what the toy does:
The first button turns on the GREEN led light
The second button turns on the RED led light
The third button turns on BOTH led lights
THe fourth button turns off all of the led lights

- How to compile it:
- How to run it: 
- How to use it: Each button of the msp430 has a different function as stated
  in the above description
